# About Me

<p style="text-align: justify;"> I completed my Bachelor’s degree at the University of Stuttgart and am currently in my master’s program Empirical Political and Social Research. Especially because of the technical & statistical orientation, it had taken me from the capital Berlin to the Schwabenmetropole Stuttgart.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the time here in Stuttgart, I have been able to expand my joy in mathematics and have discovered the statistics for me. Yes, I enjoy statistical analysis, have fun translating facts into numbers and find it nice to create appealing visualizations. In the beginning, I worked a lot with the statistical software SPSS and was able to acquire a sound knowledge there. But you quickly reach the limits with statistical software like SPSS. For some time now, I have been working intensively on the programming language R. It offers a lot of potential in terms of data analysis and visualization.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My thirst for knowledge is still not satisfied. In addition to my statistical lectures and modules, I visit numerous further education. Currently, my focus is the additional acquisition of the programming language Python and much with regard to web scraping, machine learning, Bayesian statistics and more.
Thus, I have already been able to acquire theoretical and practical experience in numerous statistical fields. I would like to share this knowledge with anyone who is interested. Because I know how many sleepless nights the statistics and especially the handling of R can bring. In addition I would like to share my own analyzes on a wide range of topics.</p>
