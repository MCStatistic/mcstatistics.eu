      <description>Introduction API for Cryptocurrencies &amp;amp; Getting the Data Plotting the Data   Introduction Working with APIs is a really powerful way to get new data you can work with. Especially if you want to make some personal projects by yourself or with friends/colleagues. However, to get full access to the data with an API, you will need to pay for it in most cases. I would like to show you a very simple way to work with APIs.</description>

      <description>Packages &amp;amp; Data Source Data Acquisition Word Matching Supervised Machine Learning Results Sentiment Analysis   For my studies I wrote a seminar paper about the agenda setting of the opposition parties in the German Bundestag. To analyze the agenda setting of the opposition parties, the minor interpellations were used. In the following I would like to show on the one hand the data acquisition and on the other hand the basic aspects of the evaluation.</description>

      <description>Introduction to dplyr filter() select() function mutate() function arrange() function group_by() &amp;amp; summarise() function   library(rmdformats) Introduction to dplyr When it comes to data manipulation, dplyr is a very powerful package with very intuitive functions. There are six important functions you will use often, if it comes to data manipulation:  filter() select() mutate() arrange() group_by() summarise()  In addition to these functions dplyr offers you the ability to use the pipe-operator out of the magrittr package.</description>

      <description>lavaan: A Package for SEM Syntax for Modelling Model Fitting (Standardized) Estimated Parameter Change Visualization: Plotting SEM Sampling Weights   lavaan: A Package for SEM In my pervious post I made a short introduction to Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). But now itâ€™s about using R for SEM. However, to use R for SEM we need the package lavaan and I will introduce the basic functions of the package. For the visualization of the models we also need the package semPlot.</description>

      <description>Introduction &amp;amp; Advantages There are a lot of variations regarding Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Therefore, this article is focusing on the basics of SEM. Fundamentally, SEM can be classified as a combination of path analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. With SEM and path analysis you will have a big felxibility for specifying relationships between theoretical constructs. For example, it is possible to postulate rather complex models that may include a single construct that is theorized to be a predictor of some constructs and is also predicted by other constructs.</description>
