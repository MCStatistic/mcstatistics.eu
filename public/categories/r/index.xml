      <description>Introduction to dplyr When it comes to data manipulation, dplyr is a very powerful package with very intuitive functions. There are six important functions you will use often, if it comes to data manipulation:
 filter() select() mutate() arrange() group_by() summarise()  In addition to these functions dplyr offers you the ability to use the pipe-operator out of the magrittr package. This operator is very useful and I highly recommend you to get used to it.</description>

      <description>lavaan: A Package for SEM Syntax for Modelling Model Fitting (Standardized) Estimated Parameter Change Visualization: Plotting SEM Sampling Weights   lavaan: A Package for SEM In my pervious post I made a short introduction to Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). But now itâ€™s about using R for SEM. However, to use R for SEM we need the package lavaan and I will introduce the basic functions of the package. For the visualization of the models we also need the package semPlot.</description>

      <description>Introduction &amp;amp; Advantages There are a lot of variations regarding Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Therefore, this article is focusing on the basics of SEM. Fundamentally, SEM can be classified as a combination of path analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. With SEM and path analysis you will have a big felxibility for specifying relationships between theoretical constructs. For example, it is possible to postulate rather complex models that may include a single construct that is theorized to be a predictor of some constructs and is also predicted by other constructs.</description>
